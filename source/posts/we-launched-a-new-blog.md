Welcome to the Flutter Bounty Hunters blog! Here you’ll find **package announcements**, 
**development education**, and updates about **how companies are using the tools that 
we build**.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the **Flutter Bounty Hunters**, 
we’re a remote team of **Flutter and Dart developers** who work **exclusively** on 
[open source packages](https://github.com/flutter-bounty-hunters). We find companies 
that need infrastructure tools, those companies hire us to build the tools they need, 
and then we open source that work for the rest of the community. To learn more about 
how we build open source packages, check out [our homepage](https://flutterbountyhunters.com).

## What you’ll learn from our blog
The Flutter Bounty Hunters blog will inform our clients and users of major package 
releases. This includes brand new packages, as well as significant changes to existing 
packages. To make sure you’re notified, consider [joining our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/ibsGtf).

At the Flutter Bounty Hunters, we work on a variety of packages, and we solve problems 
that sit at the frontier of Flutter and Dart development. We’ve built Flutter’s only 
[document editing toolkit](https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor/tree/main/super_editor), 
we’ve [re-invented text layout](https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor/tree/main/super_text_layout), 
we’ve implemented [declarative video composition with Dart and FFMPEG](https://github.com/Flutter-Bounty-Hunters/cutting_room), 
and we’ve brought [pixel painting to Flutter interfaces](https://github.com/Flutter-Bounty-Hunters/bitmap_canvas). 
As we explore new frontiers and solve new problems, we learn unique lessons about how 
to work with Flutter and Dart. We’ll share those lessons with you, through this blog.

Lastly, as a former member of the Flutter team, and the Chief of the Flutter Bounty 
Hunters, this blog will let me bring you my honest and complete thoughts about the 
direction of Flutter and Dart. Historically, I’ve posted critical thoughts to Twitter, 
but Twitter is where critique goes to die. With the Flutter Bounty Hunters blog, I can 
bring you long-form Flutter and Dart analysis.

## What you’ll get from our podcast
Today, we’re not just launching a blog. We’re also launching a podcast, called 
**On the Hunt (a Flutter podcast)**.

On the Hunt podcast will serve you in two ways. First, we’re introducing the concept 
of “micro pods”. It’s like “micro blogging” but for podcasts. I’ll take select blog 
posts and bring that same content to you in audio form. If you prefer to consume audio 
content over written content, or if you enjoy my occasional personal interjections, 
check out the podcast. Find the podcast player at the top of this very blog post! 
You can also subscribe to the podcast through the app of your choice.

In addition to our micro pods, On the Hunt will deliver interviews with industry 
veterans. You’ll hear from our clients’ developers, managers, and founders. We’ll 
talk about why our clients chose Flutter to build their user interfaces, why they 
chose to work with the Flutter Bounty Hunters, and how our clients are working to 
make the world a better place.
